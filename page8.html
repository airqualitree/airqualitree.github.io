                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-5">Higher numbers of "extremely low income" residents in a neighborhood correlate with consistently high PM2.5 levels.</h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">First, we visualized how the percentage of residents falling into certain income groups correlated with average PM2.5 levels. These income groups are determined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and are based off of the median household income in Los Angeles for a family of four ($73,100 in 2019). For simplicity, we analyzed the lowest and the highest income groups: “<strong>extremely low income</strong>”, which constitutes families making less than 30% of the median income; and “<strong>above middle income</strong>”, which include families making above the median income. If a community is composed of many residents in the “extremely low income” grouping, it is likely that the neighborhood is socioeconomically disadvantaged. Like Figures 1 and 2, each neighborhood is represented as a dot, and the acceptable PM2.5 limit is indicated as a purple dashed line.<br><br><strong>Figure 5</strong> demonstrates that communities composed of 30%+ “extremely low income” residents consistently experience PM2.5 levels above the acceptable EPA limit. The low variance in the extremely low income data points above 30% indicates that the number of residents in this income group is a decisive factor in determining a community’s exposure to pollution. On the other hand, the relationship between the number of  “above middle income” residents and pollution is opposite. Neighborhoods with few residents in this income group experience consistently high PM2.5 levels, but above 20%+, the data points begin to trend downwards. It is important to note that neighborhoods with most residents in the “above middle income” grouping have a lot of variance in PM2.5 levels, with some neighborhoods experiencing relatively low levels and others still having levels above the EPA limit; therefore, other factors other than socioeconomic status are likely playing a role in determining pollutant exposure. Nevertheless, the number of low income residents in a neighborhood is extremely important and correlates well with PM2.5 levels, with more low income residents increasing that community’s exposure to air pollutants.<br></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Another method to parameterize socioeconomic status is the percentage of residents who fall under the poverty threshold set by the U.S. Census Bureau, as illustrated in <strong>Figure 6</strong>. Unlike the previous visualizations, Figure 6 is a bar graph; this choice was because we grouped the neighborhood into four quartiles, depending on how many of their residents fell under the poverty line. The leftmost bar (lowest 25%) represents neighborhoods with the lowest levels of residents in poverty and thus include the most affluent neighborhoods. Likewise, the rightmost bar includes neighborhoods with high levels of poverty and thus less affluent communities. The standard deviation of each quartile subgroup’s PM2.5 concentrations was calculated and used as the error bars.<br><br>The most affluent neighborhoods with the lowest levels of poverty experience an average PM2.5 concentration of 11.434 𝜇g/cubic meter, which is lower than the other three subgroups. As one goes up in quartiles, the PM2.5 levels increase, with the most severe air pollution experienced by the top 25% neighborhoods in poverty. However, the error bars for each of these subgroups is relatively large, causing them to overlap with each other. Therefore, there is quite a bit of variance in PM2.5 levels even when accounting for poverty levels, indicating that other confounding variables, like weather or demographic factors, may be contributing to air pollution. Nevertheless, despite this limitation, these averages generally corroborate with Figure 5 and support the argument that less socioeconomically advantaged communities experience greater levels of PM2.5 pollution.<br></p>

To study how drinking water contamination (as measured by the CalEnviroScreen’s drinking water contamination index) is spatially distributed across Los Angeles, we created a map that shows the average drinking water contamination across Los Angeles neighborhoods at a census-tract level. The drinking water contamination index accounts for the concentrations of 13 contaminants; these values are not concentrations but rather percentiles, with higher values indicating more contamination.</h4>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">We see that along the coastal areas and near the beaches, drinking water contaminants appear to be less prevalent, as indicated by the relatively low index. In contrast, neighborhoods in the east side of Los Angeles generally have higher indices and thus more water pollution. Since neighborhoods on the westside of Los Angeles (Beverly Hills, Westwood, Malibu) tend to be more affluent than ones downtown or close to the Inland Empire, we argue that the spatial distribution of water contamination demonstrates a potential relationship between socioeconomic factors and water quality. <br><br>However, it is also important to note that many affluent neighborhoods, such as Beverly Hills, are not in the lowest bracket of drinking water contaminants. Instead, they have contamination indices around 300-500, so this relationship between socioeconomic status and water pollution may have other factors confounding our analysis. For instance, drinking water infrastructure is not necessarily restricted to a specific census-tract. As a result, the act of analyzing drinking water on a census-tract level may not account for infrastructure spanning across multiple tracts, potentially complicating our findings.<br></p>

Although greenspace may not have the same direct health effects as air or water pollution, the amount of greenspace can affect one’s mental health, their access to recreation, and how they view themselves relative to the environment around them. We hypothesized that more affluent neighborhoods have more access to greenspace and are thus less likely to be concrete jungles than more socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods.</h4>

As a result, predominantly Black communities likely experience higher ambient air pollution regardless of other social factors. On the other hand, as the percentage of white residents increases, there is little change in average PM2.5 concentrations. Some predominantly white communities have PM2.5 levels much lower than the acceptable limit, while others are marginally higher. Nevertheless, the relationship between the percentage of white residents and PM2.5 concentrations is much less correlated than the percentage of Black residents, indicating that (1) the trend observed in Fig. 1a for predominantly Black communities is not seen as with white communities, and (2) it is likely that other confounding variables (e.g. household income, age) contribute to differences in air quality among predominantly white communities.">

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Noting that maps convey geospatial arguments, we utilized latitude and longitude coordinates of Los Angeles neighborhoods  as a platform to investigate how spatial distribution of greenspace is related to socioeconomic status. Drawing on data from an <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0122051" class="text-primary" target="_blank">Urban Tree Canopy Cover and Environmental Justice study</a>&nbsp;to create this visualization, this interactive map connects one’s location, their neighborhood’s median household income, and the neighborhood’s green space urban tree canopy covering. Furthermore, it also includes the neighborhood’s water contamination index and its average PM2.5 concentration to summarize our previous analyses.<br><br>The colors, which represent a neighborhood’s income, demonstrate that many Los Angeles neighborhoods may be considered lower-income, as indicated by the large number of red circles. Since the size represents the percentage of urban tree canopy, the map argues that more affluent areas (colored in green) appear to have more green space and less air and water pollutants. Although we acknowledge that there are lots of data points (i.e. neighborhoods) missing due to filtering null values, the map still shows a correlation between socioeconomic status and greenspace and summarizes many of the trends from Figures 1-4 regarding water and air pollution.<br></p>
