                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">To determine whether racial composition affects whether a neighborhood is exposed to higher PM2.5 levels, a scatter plot was created with the percentage of residents in a specific neighborhood who identify as Black, white, Asian, or Latino as the independent variable and the averaged PM2.5 concentrations from the CalEnviroScreen 2.0 and 3.0 surveys as the dependent variable. PM2.5, or particulate matter with diameters of less than 2.5 micrometers, is an important air pollutant that poses dangerous effects to our respiratory and cardiovascular systems; therefore, we use PM2.5 throughout this study as a way to quantify air quality.<br><br>Since both variables are numeric ratios and each neighborhood is associated with a specific value for each variable, we represent each neighborhood as a dot. Thus, we can compare any trends we may see across neighborhoods on a 2D coordinate plane. Percentages (rather than raw population counts) were used to normalize to different census tracts’ populations, and a scatter plot was chosen because each data point is discrete. Furthermore, dot sizes were calculated by the number of measurements taken in each neighborhood, as certain neighborhoods had more measurements than others. Since a smaller measurement sample size could skew the average a lot more than larger datasets, they are visually weighted less than communities with more measurements. We plotted two races on each graph so that one could act as a point of comparison for the other: does an observed relationship appear across multiple racial groups or a select few? Are observed relationships observed regardless of racial composition?<br><br><strong>Fig. 1 </strong>illustrates that once the percentage of Black residents reaches above 20%, the average PM2.5 concentration is consistently higher than the EPA’s acceptable limit (12 micrograms/cubic meter).

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Figs. 2a and 2b</strong> use similar analysis to investigate how the percentage of Asian and Latino residents in a community correlates with PM2.5 concentrations, with the percentage of white residents also serving as a point-of-comparison for both. In <strong>Fig. 2a</strong>, we observe that like predominantly Black communities, once the percentage of Asian residents in a neighborhood exceeds 20%, the data points cluster above the acceptable limit, although a select few data points (like at 60% Asian composition) lay below the limit. On the contrary, <strong>Fig. 2b</strong> demonstrates that the trend for predominantly Latino communities is more similar to white neighborhoods than the previous trends for Black or Asian communities. At both low and high Latino percentages, neighborhoods experience relatively similar air pollution, albeit with a couple of outliers between 20% and 60%. These outliers may be due to other confounding factors that influence a community’s exposure to particulate matter, as mentioned above.<br></p>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-7">However, average PM2.5 levels do not describe the entire picture, as air quality is a dynamic variable. For instance, one neighborhood may have experienced excellent air quality at the beginning of the measurement period which deteriorated over time, while other neighborhoods may have had the opposite experience. These changes over time may serve as a proxy for relative racial empowerment, as improving air quality may be due to increased political advocacy, capital, or social concern for the marginalized groups. Likewise, worse air quality over time may indicate relative disempowerment, as increased particulate matter concentrations could be caused by recent construction of pollutant sources (e.g. factories) close to the neighborhood. <br><br>Given Los Angeles’ recent failure in cleaning the lead-contaminated Exide battery factory and continued conversations about environmental injustices, we hypothesized that the air quality in neighborhoods with large numbers of people of color will worsen over time compared to predominantly white communities. To analyze our data, we took advantage of our dataset containing data from two measurement campaigns: the <strong>CalEnviroScreen 2.0 </strong>(collected between 2009-2011) and <strong>3.0</strong> (2012-2014). Thus, by separating the data into their respective campaigns, calculating the mean of each campaign, and subtracting the mean PM2.5 concentration of the later 3.0 campaign by the earlier 2.0, we can see whether pollution improved (as shown by a negative (-) difference) or worsened (positive (+) differences).</h4>

This finding may be due to multiple factors: first, it is possible that Black and Asian neighborhoods have gained political capital through activism and political engagement, allowing them to advocate for clean-up efforts. Secondly, it could also be because Black and Asian communities experience more severe air pollution in the first place. Since it is easier to improve air quality in heavily polluted areas versus areas that already have clean air in the first place, these findings could instead be a symptom of the existing racial disparity itself. Finally, variations can also be due to other physical or social factors. The prevalence of wildfires, for instance, can affect particulate matter concentrations, so if one of these time periods had worse fire seasons, this variable would not be accounted for in our visualizations.</p>
