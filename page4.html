Neighborhood Oil Drilling and Environmental Justice in Los&nbsp;<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Angeles. In Inevitably Toxic (p. 207–). University of Pittsburgh Press.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This book chapter covers the history of oil drilling in Los Angeles County and the fights&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for environmental justice that are associated with it. Located in one of the most&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">concentrated deposits of crude oil in the world, </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Los Angeles is littered with thousands of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">active oil wells. However, the effects of minimal regulation at multiple levels </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">government and corporate control have created a situation where low-income, non-white&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">neighborhoods are </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">disproportionately </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">impacted by unsafe wells close to schools, homes,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">and parks, negatively impacting the air and water. Their </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">plights are often </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">ignored by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">l</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">ocal, state, and national governments. This chapter provides a good case study of the&nbsp;</span></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fights for environmental justice in Los Angeles County, both in the past and in the&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modern era. It also highlights the large role oil plays in affecting the air and water quality of communities in Los Angeles County, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and how this environmental burden is not shared equally among communities along socioeconomic and racial lines.</div><div><br></div><div>Environmental Justice Coalition for Water, International Human Rights Law Clinic at University of California, Berkeley, and Safe &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Alliance.

Many low-income, minority residents are&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more likely to be exposed to water contamination and depend on poorly maintained,&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outdated water infrastructure to provide that water, particularly those in impoverished&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rural areas that are also unable to afford to upgrade their water systems. In urban areas,</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water is often contaminated by industrial waste so that urban residents are only provided&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;polluted tap water and public schools in poorer areas may not have access to affordable&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clean water for their students. One pressing issue for both areas that especially impacts&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;low-income residents is the double cost of drinking water: when tap water is unsafe,&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people must both pay for their unusable polluted tap water and separately buy clean bottled water. The report provides &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information on how water infrastructure as well as&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">industrial waste can impact water quality across all spaces in California, as well </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">as some&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">opinions on what can be done to alleviate lack of water access. Furthermore, it explains&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">how unsafe water specifically </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">impacts underprivileged communities and relates to </span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">understanding the relevance of our data project.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Imperial, Mark T. “Environmental Justice and Water Pollution Control: The Clean Water Act Construction Grants Program.” Public &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;works management &amp; policy 4, no. 2 (1999): 100–118.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/249622414_Environmental_Justice_and_Water_Pollution_Control_The_Clean_Water_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Act_Construction_Grants_Program</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This study analyzes data regarding the Clean Water Act’s Construction Grant Program&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whether grant money was distributed equitably to counties to revamp their&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;publicly-owned water treatment facilities. Three main groups of variables were&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;investigated: the county’s population size and density; a county’s average household&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;income, and minority composition. Federal funding data from the Census Bureau was the&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dependent variable, and ordinary least-squares regression and logistic regression were&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;used to determine correlations and their significance. The analysis found that population&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;size became the most important predictor of grant shares at high populations, far&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outweighing minority composition and household income; however, this trend was&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nonlinear, with fewer grants given to extremely wealthy communities, potentially due to&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their ability to utilize outside resources. Increasing minority composition also decreased&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the probability that the county received a grant. This study shows how federal funding&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could exacerbate certain inequities from a water treatment lens, and it serves as a&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;potential model to help guide our analysis on LA water quality. For instance, the&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paper indicates that there is strong correlation between a county’s population and its&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minority composition; as a result, it is difficult to separate the two effects in their&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;analysis. This problem is likely one that we will encounter in our project, and so this&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;project’s data analysis provides a starting point to guide our data normalization.</div><div><br></div><div>Jerrett, M, R.T Burnett, P Kanaroglou, J Eyles, N Finkelstein, And C Giovis. “A GIS-Environmental Justice Analysis of Particulate Air &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pollution in Hamilton, Canada.” Environment and planning.

Concentrations of suspended&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particulates from monitoring stations were interpolated and overlaid onto a census map,&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and least-squares regression was conducted to find correlations. Property values was the&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most significant variable, with the variable being negatively correlated with pollution.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Income and unemployment were also correlated with pollution, while immigration (a&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proxy for racial makeup) did not have significant correlation, potentially highlighting&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;differences in racial dynamics between Canada and the United States. This study serves&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as a model for how spatial statistics can be used to display pollution concentrations; by&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interpolating measurements, the study was able to create maps that depict how pollutant&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concentrations changed between stations. As a result, we can use similar methodology in&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our project when creating map visualizations of air quality in Los Angeles to transform&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discrete data points into continuous colormaps.</div><div><br></div><div>Lai, Yuan, and Constantine E.

The article uses open data collection and data mining and explores how these models can &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lead to a greater understanding of urban forestry. The data collected includes geolocation, species and much more on 652,169 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;street trees as well as supplementary data on pollen activity, allergen severity, land use, housing conditions, and neighborhood &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demographic data.  The article explores this data by integrating data on asthma hospitalization rates and PM2.5 concentrations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion from this data is that greater concentration of trees assist with air pollution but certain species have a pollen that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can increase local asthma hospitalization rates in vulnerable populations. This article made a big point about data collection and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mining which led me to think about ways we can integrate our data sources together. It also helped me understand that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;something that seems universally good, like planting more trees, can have negative consequences on certain populations. It &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reminded me that it is important to actively search for the negatives and not just the conclusion we are looking for.</div><div><br></div><div>Mekonnen, Zesemayat K, John W Oehlert, Brenda Eskenazi, Gary M Shaw, John R Balmes, and Amy M Padula. “The Relationship &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between Air Pollutants and Maternal Socioeconomic Factors on Preterm Birth in California Urban Counties.” Journal of exposure &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;science &amp; environmental epidemiology 31, no. 3 (2021): 503–513.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41370-021-00323-7</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article argues that there is a positive association between maternal exposures to PM2.5 and O3 air pollutants and preterm &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;birth. The researchers reached this conclusion by building mixed-effects models using daily quality data on PM2.5 and O3, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;geocoded birth certificate data, and census tract-level socioeconomic data. The models revealed that there is an average &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increased risk for preterm birth for every one unit increase in PM2.5 over the entire pregnancy and in O3 over the 3-month &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pre-pregnancy period. This resource is important because it demonstrates the health impacts of poor air quality and how it is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;related to socioeconomic factors. It also reinforces why it is important to study air quality through an environmental justice lens &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because it clearly has a very real impact on certain communities. This article demonstrates how important it is that our project &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should not only include our findings but also include resources for marginalized communities to advocate for policy changes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that will mitigate the effects of poor air quality.</div><div><br></div><br><div>Nowak, David J, Daniel E Crane, and Jack C Stevens. “Air Pollution Removal by Urban Trees and Shrubs in the United States.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urban forestry &amp; urban greening 4, no. 3 (2006): 115–123</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1618866706000173</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article argues that urban tree canopy cover removes large amounts of air pollution, improves air quality, and in turn, the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;management of it would help urban areas meet clean air standards. The researchers reached this conclusion by estimating &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pollution removal by urban trees using pollution concentration data and amount of tree coverage. This resource is important &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because it demonstrates that there is a positive relationship between the amount of tree canopy cover and air quality in urban &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;areas. In combination with other literature that argues that more affluent neighborhoods tend to have higher levels of tree canopy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cover, this article pushes us to consider which neighborhoods do not have access to urban tree canopy coverage and what &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;communities those neighborhoods serve. With that information, we are able to take a closer look at which communities are more &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impacted by poor air quality.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Pastor, M., Sadd, J.

This &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;correlation strongly affects communities of color and those below the poverty line. This paper is relevant to our dataset because it &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not only provides concurring evidence that non-white communities are the victims of environmental injustice, but it explores the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;negative impacts environmental injustice has not only on public health, but on education and economics (in the form of human &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capital). This article also controls for other factors that may explain diminished school performance and is useful for analysis of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why our data is relevant and important, especially as the demand for schools increases in the Los Angeles area.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Pearce, J, S Kingham, And P Zawar-Reza. “Every Breath You Take? Environmental Justice and Air Pollution in Christchurch, New &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zealand.” Environment and planning. A 38, no. 5 (2006): 919–938.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1068/a37446</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pearce and Zawar-Reza investigated correlations between ambient and acute air pollution in Christchurch, New Zealand with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;social demographic data, including ethnicity, age, social deprivation (a combination of multiple social indices), and income. Air &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pollution was measured via an atmospheric model that incorporated local emissions with meteorology and transport, and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regression analysis was conducted with mean PM10 concentrations, number of days that exceed a regulatory value, and social &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;factors. They discovered that areas with high numbers of residents between 15-34 years old experienced the highest levels of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particulate matter, and that the social deprivation score correlated significantly with the amount of ambient and acute pollution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, ethnicity did not correlate strongly with air pollution when the other social factors were accounted for, although this &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finding may be due to New Zealand’s high ethnic homogeneity. They also discovered that the burden of air pollution was not &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equal: the areas that emitted the most particulates through domestic heating did not experience the most severe pollution events. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper was significant in that it was one of the first environmental justice analyses conducted in New Zealand that accounted &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for pollutant transport and weather, rather than simply analyzing the static location of hazardous waste sites. This paper parallels &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much of our proposed methodology: we will be using PM10 as well to study the Los Angeles basin, and we plan to use similar &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demographic factors to find correlations. Although we will not have the resources to run atmospheric models on pollution &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plumes, the paper indicates that a location’s meteorology may impact air pollution and may thus be a confounding variable in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our data visualizations.</div><div><br></div><div>Roth, Sammy. “Why Communities Fighting for Fair Policing Also Demand Environmental Justice.” Los Angeles Times. June 4, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2020.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2020-06-04/why-communities-fighting-for-fair-policing-also-demand- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;environmental-justice-boiling-point.&nbsp;</div><br><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article by reporter Sammy Roth focuses on environmental injustice, in the overall US and particularly in the Los Angeles &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Area. She cites instances of lead-contaminated soil and water, air pollution from gas wells, and other environmental hazards that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are much more likely to be in or near working-class neighbourhoods. Per several investigations by the Los Angeles Times, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pollutants and waste sites were disproportionately more often found near low-income, Black, and Latino residents. The article &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mentions redlining and how it has caused generations of people of colour to be refused home loans and insurance for certain &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;locations, and how that may contribute to the distribution of polluted land today. Roth gives insight into how environmental &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;injustice as a whole impacts those of less privileged socioeconomic statuses. The article’s findings can be applied to show how &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our focus, water and air quality, is tied to systems that have historically sidelined communities of colour and explain a cause of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the disparities found in our data analysis when we look at air and water pollution by race.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><br><div>Schaider, Laurel A, Lucien Swetschinski, Christopher Campbell, and Ruthann A Rudel. “Environmental Justice and Drinking &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water Quality: Are There Socioeconomic Disparities in Nitrate Levels in U.S. Drinking Water?” Environmental health 18, no. 1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2019): 3–3.</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-018-0442-6</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This article argues that even after accounting for county-level cropland and livestock production, communities water systems &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(CWSs) in the top percentile of Hispanic residents exceeded the average nitrate concentration, 5 mg/L, three times as often as &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CWSs serving the lowest percentile. However, the proportion of residents living in poverty and proportion of African American &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;residents were both inversely related with nitrate levels. The researchers came to these conclusions by conducting mixed-effects &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;multivariate regression analyses using the nitrate data from 39,466 U.S. CWSs over a five-year period and demographic data &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the U.S. Census. This resource is important because it somewhat corroborates our theory that minority communities, in this &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;case,  Hispanic communities, are often impacted by poor water quality caused by pollutants. It also provides opposing evidence &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to our hypothesis that all communities with lower socioeconomic backgrounds suffer poorer water quality. However, it is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;important to note that this article only studies nitrate levels, while our water quality data set has information about 13 different &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;water pollutants. When thinking about our project, this article has encouraged us to consider the possibility that different &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marginalized communities may be dealing with different water pollutants.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><br><div>Schwarz, Kirsten, Michail Fragkias, Christopher G.

What was concluded is that income is generally strongly correlated with urban tree canopy cover, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whereas race and ethnicity is not as large of a factor. However, this is not the case in Los Angeles - the percentage of black and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hispanic ethnicities in certain areas and greenspace are “strongly and negatively correlated.” To find this, geographical &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;information system mapping in conjunction with social variables like race, ethnicity, income, and education attainment from the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Census was utilized. Additional supplemental articles such as how environmental justice relates to parks and tree cover and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;environmental benefits and burdens of trees with socioeconomic contexts in cities were used to help generate this critical &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research. In the context of our project, this information can help provide insight when analyzing trends with air and water quality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With an environmental justice lens, cross-referencing urban tree canopy cover with socioeconomic data and our air and water &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quality can help us create connections and supply more background information as to why certain conditions in different parts of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Los Angeles county are the way they are.</div><div><br></div><div>Shamasunder, Bhavna, Ashley Collier-Oxandale, Jessica Blickley, James Sadd, Marissa Chan, Sandy Navarro, Michael Hannigan, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Nicole J.

After these studies, the researchers found that many in these communities had no knowledge of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an oil production site within 1500 feet of their neighborhood, could not determine potential harmful odors, and did not know &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how to make reports to air quality agencies. Furthermore, it is known that oil and gas development is correlated with poor air &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quality and as a result, more likely for adverse health effects.

Environmental hazards like air pollutants—specifically PM 2.5—were identified and investigated, and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scientific and statistical analysis was conducted for measuring inequality index, environmental impact, and race-ethnicity with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;socioeconomic position. This combines into what the researchers coin “CEHII,” the cumulative environmental hazard inequality &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;index. Much like the backing for our research questions, their conclusion regarding communities of color with lower &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;socioeconomic status having more “environmental burdens” than non-ethnic and affluent communities supports our &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;environmental justice lens with air and water quality. The CEHII can also provide insight for potential future steps and policies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that address how to bridge the gap with all the disparities facing Los Angeles. Some examples they provide, which we can &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;definitely include in our website for steps moving forward, are cleaner production and more green spaces, which relates to the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;green space disparity that we are also focusing on.</div><div><br></div><div>West, Jason J., and Aaron Cohen. 2016. “What We Breathe Impacts Our Health: Improving Understanding of the Link between Air &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pollution and Health.” Environ.

The report contained many sources such as 20 years of data on global PM2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concentrations and reports on the link between health and air pollution. These sources show that over the last 20 years the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;concentration of PM2.5 has been decreasing in North America and Europe, while increasing in South America and Asia &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially in mega cities.  The author goes on to discuss how the data collection methods have improved which has led to greater &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accuracy but how we are still lacking the methods and tools to gather data on mixtures of gasses and pollutants.  The PM2.5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pollutant is also very deadly leading to 2.9 million premature deaths in 2013 and ranked as the 7th most important risk factor &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contributing to global mortality.  The report ends with how better policy and more knowledge on the subject could provide a path &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forward. This report can apply directly to our research questions about how air pollution can negatively affect health. Specifically &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the data on PM2.5 as that is what is tracked in our own dataset.</div><div><br></div><div>World Health Organization. Government publication. Air Pollution and Child Health: Prescribing Clean Air. 2018.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/air-pollution-and-child-health.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Health Organisation’s (WHO) report investigates data on air pollution and its ramifications regarding child health, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the intention of informing health care professionals on how to act to prevent air pollution-caused damage. The report &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;compiles information from various WHO studies between 2006 and 2016 to examine ambient air pollution -- contamination from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fossil fuel usage, industry, agriculture, waste incineration, and natural disasters -- and household pollution -- from unhealthy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cooking fuels, hearth fires, and other household sources -- and what percentage of children internationally are exposed to these &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;types of air pollution, with a consideration to whether these children belong to low income areas or certain age groups. The &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;report found that in general, children face severe health consequences from polluted air and are a vulnerable group due to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;factors like more time spent playing outside in polluted air or inside near cooking fires, greater exposure as fetuses, lack of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;autonomy to leave their environment, and immature development. Exposure to air pollution was found to correlate with &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;significantly higher child mortality, negative birth outcomes like low birth weight and more stillbirths, slower neurological &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development, obesity, asthma, childhood cancers, and even health issues later in life like adult cardiovascular disease. Overall, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the report emphasises the myriad health issues stemming from air pollution and the importance of protecting children from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them. Though the report doesn’t focus on California, the results are still applicable to our project. Children are vital to a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;community’s longevity and ability to flourish and improve itself, so it is important to recognise how they are impacted by &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inadequate air quality and how that disrupts community growth, prevents upward social and economic mobility, and causes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long-term health inequality.</div><div><br></div></h4>
